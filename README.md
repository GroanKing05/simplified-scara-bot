# Systems Thinking Project (Simplified Scara Robot)

## Overview
This project involves the simulation of a simplified SCARA robot (a non-planar model, with 1 rotational and 1 translational degree of freedom) using MATLAB Simulink. The project contains the Simulink files, a detailed report (in PDF format), and reference materials for further study.
<!-- A non-planar model, with 1 rotational and 1 translational degree of freedom.
This Repository consists of the following files: -->

## Content
- **[Report](
    simplified-scara-bot/Report/Systems_Thinking_Project_Report.pdf
    )**: A detailed report on the project, including the problem statement, system description, system analysis, and results.
- **[Simulink Files](
    simplified-scara-bot/Simulink/
    )**: Contains the Simulink model files for the simplified SCARA robot.
- **[Reference Materials](
    simplified-scara-bot/Reference/
    )**: Contains reference materials for further study.

## How to Make the Most of This Repository?
- Read the report to understand the problem statement, system description, system analysis, and results.
- Open the Simulink model files in MATLAB to run the simulation and try changing the parameters, inputs, add new blocks/features, etc. This is the best way to understand the system dynamics.
- Refer to the reference materials for further study.

## What You Will Learn?
- **SCARA Robot Kinematics**: Understand the forward and inverse kinematics of a SCARA robot, and how they are modeled in Simulink.
- **Control Systems**: Gain insights into basic control strategies used for robotic systems.
- **MATLAB Simulink Skills**: Improve your proficiency with MATLAB Simulink by studying and modifying the pre-built model.
- **Simulation and Analysis**: Learn how to run simulations, interpret the results, and relate them to real-world robot behavior.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command in the terminal:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GroanKing05/simplified-scara-bot.git
    ```
2. Install MATLAB with the Simulink package and Simscape Multibody Library for simulation.
3. Open the Simulink model files in MATLAB and run the simulation.
