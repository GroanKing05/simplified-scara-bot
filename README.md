# Systems Thinking Project (Simplified Scara Robot)

## Overview
This project involves the simulation of a simplified SCARA robot (a non-planar model, with 1 rotational and 1 translational degree of freedom) using MATLAB Simulink. The project contains the Simulink files, a detailed report (in PDF format), and reference materials for further study.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command in the terminal:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GroanKing05/simplified-scara-bot.git
    ```
2. Install MATLAB with the 'Simulink' package and 'Simscape Multibody Library' for running simulations.
3. Open the Simulink model files in MATLAB-Simulink and run the simulation.
